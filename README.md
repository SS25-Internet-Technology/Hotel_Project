# Hotel_Project

# 1. Analysis
### Scenario
The hotel reservation system is designed to manage room bookings, additional services, and payment processing for a hotel. The system supports different room categories, seasonal pricing, smoking and non-smoking preferences, and payment method is selectable at check-in. It also allows for the recording of additional services such as PayTV and minibar usage. The system provides real-time availability of rooms per category for any given date or period.

### User Stories
1.	As an admin, I want to view so that I can explore and manage room categories, including single, double, smoking, and non-smoking rooms.
2.	As an admin, I want to set and adjust seasonal prices for different room categories so that the pricing reflects high and low demand periods.
3.	As an admin, I want to view, edit, and delete reservations so that I can ensure accuracy and address any booking issues.
4.	As an admin, I want to manage additional services such as PayTV and minibar so that I can add, edit, or remove service options available to guests.
5.	As an admin, I want to determine the available rooms per category for a specific date or period so that I can provide accurate availability information to potential guests.
6.	As an admin, I want to log in so that I can authenticate myself and access the admin functionalities securely.
